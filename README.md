# Wireless-LED-Brightness-Control
This project demonstrates a wireless LED brightness control system using Arduino and UART communication. The brightness of an LED is controlled by adjusting a potentiometer connected to one Arduino, which transmits data via UART
# Wireless LED Brightness Control using UART

## 📌 Project Description
This project demonstrates a **wireless LED brightness control system** using **Arduino and UART communication**. A **potentiometer** connected to one Arduino transmits brightness data via **UART** to another Arduino, which controls an LED using **PWM (Pulse Width Modulation).**

## ⚙️ Features
✅ Wireless LED brightness control  
✅ Real-time data transmission using UART  
✅ Analog input from a potentiometer  
✅ PWM-based brightness adjustment  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Microcontroller:** Arduino Uno  
- **Communication:** UART (Serial Communication)  
- **Control Method:** PWM (Pulse Width Modulation)  
- **Software:** Arduino IDE  

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Connect **Potentiometer** to **Arduino #1** (Sender)  
2. Connect **LED** to **Arduino #2** (Receiver)  
3. Upload the Arduino codes (provided in the repository)  
4. Adjust the **potentiometer** to control LED brightness wirelessly
